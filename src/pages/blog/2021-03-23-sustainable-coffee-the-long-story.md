Welcome to the wonderful world of sustainable coffee - we promise that after reading this blog post, you'll be surprised! First of all it's important to think about what sustainable coffee actually means.  Direct trading, "three coffee packs with 10€ sale", organic coffee, Fairtrade - how these things affect the coffee farmers and coffee's sustainability? Does it matter what kind of coffee a consumer buys?

*[ps. you can read this whole post also in Finnish here.](https://blog.warriorcoffee.com/blogi/eettisen-kahvin-aapinen)*

We took a close look at all of these things a couple of years ago, and we started to search for our sustainable coffee, for our unique model. Have a read what we learned and how we came to our conclusions of the whole thing. Relax, pour yourself a nice cup of (hopefully sustainable) coffee and enjoy!

Our definition of sustainable coffee is that all participants in the coffee value chain (from the coffee farmer to the coffee roaster) has a possibility to do profitable business so that human rights and general good business practices are followed. So, that every person in the coffee value chain can go to sleep happy and wake up to make a good cup of coffee that he/she knows is fair to all the participants.

The problem in this equation is that this is not the situation at the moment, there are major issues in the coffee value chain, and that's why we want to do our part as the coffee roaster.

[The issues in the coffee procurement ](https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2018/11/sustainability-in-coffee-what-are-the-main-issues/) have been quite well documented, but especially within the people who work in the coffee industry, [the problem has been known for a long time](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/03/27/coffee-producers-demand-immediate-action-amidst-price-crisis/) - actually as long as the world coffee prices have been declining. The sustainability view is especially important in Finland, because first of all we have the ability to buy sustainable coffee and also because Finnish people drink the most coffee IN THE WORLD per capita ([year 2018 an average Finn drank coffee worth 12 kgs of roasted coffee beans](http://gcrmag.com/profile/view/nordic-by-nature)).

The coffee farmers face the most serious problems at the moment, and the main reason for that is the [world coffee prices that have fallen  around -35% ](https://ycharts.com/indicators/world_coffee_arabica_price)[since the end of 2016](https://ycharts.com/indicators/world_coffee_arabica_price)[](https://ycharts.com/indicators/world_coffee_arabica_price) - while costs (workforce prices, energy prices, etc.) have risen, so the money amount that the coffee farmer receives from the coffee has reduced significantly [(during the decades the purchasing power has decreased even -80% in some regions](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/03/27/coffee-producers-demand-immediate-action-amidst-price-crisis/)). The farmers' situation is the weakest in this coffee value chain (as they have the least negotiating power), and they receive the money amount that the market decides and that's it. This applies specifically to the bulk coffee that the biggest coffee roasters use. The coffee berry develops quite slowly and the harvest fluctuates over time but the costs remain the same - it's difficult for the farmer to prepare for what's coming and what kind of price he/she will get from the coffee, especially when the other support from the society / government is not on the level that is, e.g., in Finland.

 

## COFFEE AS A TRAFFIC BUILDING PRODUCT

Traffic building is a strategy that bigger retailers use to attract customers into their stores. Coffee has been a major traffic building product to attract customers to the supermarkets (as we Finns and other Scandinavians drink so much coffee). However, the problems of the coffee farmers are not addressed as much as they should in the Finnish media. The reason for that may be that from a Western country perspective, actually everyone gets more money.

At least in theory the coffee roasters make more profit, as their most important ingredient's price goes down (as 60-70% of the production cost of a coffee package is the coffee bean), and the consumers "win", because the price of the coffee package remains low in the supermarket and it still can be used as a traffic building product. Please note, that this has nothing to do with the taste or the quality of the coffee.
